            Article 343 of the Constitution of India stated that the official language of the Union is Hindi in Devanagari script, with official use of English to continue for 15 years from 1947. In 1963, a constitutional amendment, The Official Languages Act, allowed for the continuation of English alongside Hindi in the Indian government indefinitely until legislation decides to change it.The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union are "the international form of Indian numerals",which are referred to as Arabic numerals in most English-speaking countries.Despite some misconceptions, Hindi is not the national language of India; the Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language.
